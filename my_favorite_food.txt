My favorit food is Tabbouleh 
I consists of the following:
1/2 cup extra fine bulgur wheat
4 firm Roma tomatoes, very finely chopped
1 English cucumber (hothouse cucumber), very finely chopped
2 bunches parsley, part of the stems removed, washed and well-dried, very finely chopped
12–15 fresh mint leaves, stems removed, washed, well-dried, very finely chopped
4 green onions, white and green parts, very finely chopped
Salt
3–4 tbsp lime juice (lemon juice, if you prefer)
3–4 tbsp Early Harvest extra virgin olive oil
Romaine lettuce leaves to serve, optional

Yummy
